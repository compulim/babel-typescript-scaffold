# babel-typescript-scaffold

My own scaffold for compiling TypeScript using Babel in a modern way.

## Things I like

- Compile using Babel on a file-by-file basis
  - Clean and tidy
- Single source code build pipeline

## Things I don't like

- Type-checking on the side
  - Need to run `TSC` just for type-checking, using [`concurrently`](https://npmjs.com/package/concurrently)
  - TypeScript output is ugly (multiple empty lines)
- Create declaration files (`*.d.ts`) using `TSC`
  - May be it is a limitation on Babel on outputting multiple files
  - The preset don't support `tsconfig.json` yet
- No source map generated by [`@babel/preset-typescript`](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-typescript)
  - It is not taking in `tsconfig.json`
  - Also not receiving options in `.babelrc`
- Jest read wrong version of `babel-core@6` instead of `@babel/core@7`
